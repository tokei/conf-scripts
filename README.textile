h2. conf+scripts

These are just some personal config files and scripts that I want to keep save and that might be of interest for others too. I would be very interessted in any feedback so feel free to drop me a line. 

/tokei, tokei@cccmz.de


h2. Table of contents:

* .gitconfig - global git configuration with some colors
* bashrc
** .bashrc - main .bashrc with prompt and paths
** alias.sh - useful aliases
** parse_git_branch.sh - bash function to parse the git branch of the current directory to be used in the prompt
* .vimrc - vim configuration with tab options and functions to toggle syntax and spell check

_Please remember that most of the config files start with a dot so they might not show up on a `ls`, depending on your parameters._
